# Information regarding this project repository

## Goals
  The goal of this project is to display a solid understanding of how forms should be structured, how they operate, and how to handle basic HTML5 form validation. I went a little further and also improved the Web Accessibility Compliance as well as adding additional features. I utilized a Fluid Mobile First approach to designing this so as to maximize not only cross browser compatibility but also cross platform compatibility as well.

## Description
  A _Mobile-First Responsive_ registration form. Incorporated various html input types and associated attributes for form control. Form implements html5 form validations such as **_required_** and simple valid email check. Form is **WCAG** compliant passing Chrome Dev Tools Lighthouse audits and utilizes semantic markup for the architecture of the html. The form also includes an elegant "blur-in" animation for the sake of presentation purposes.
